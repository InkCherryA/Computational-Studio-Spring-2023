                    The secret to the rapidly developing technology today is the invention of the Consciousness Transmitter (CT). It allows the subject’s consciousness to be uploaded into a preprogrammed simulation where the subject will acquire a certain skill or conduct certain experiments. In those sandboxes, time-flow velocity (TFV) is customizable. However, based on the complexity and scale of the simulation, there is a limit to the conversion ratio to prevent system malfunction, which in most cases results in death of the subjects. 
                    <br><br>
                    There is also a high level of artificial general intelligence (AGI) technology available for use among some of the large organizations. This technology is later revealed to be the consciousness transmitter itself. It duplicates human consciousness and manipulates their memories only to sell them as artificial intelligence.
                    <br><br>
                    There are a number of organizations that have access to the CT and AGI technologies. One of them is responsible for the education of citizens. A ten-year simulation of education is mandatory for everyone, which has a TFV ratio of 1/5, meaning a two-year session in the real world. During this simulation, everyone is given randomized identity and no prior memory, which alleviates conflicts between physically determined social groups.

                    The planet is very similar to earth in terms of size, the plants have a purple tint instead of green.

                <li class="text3">
                    There are four main families of intelligent lifeforms on the planet: hominidae [human], octopodidae [octopus], corvidae [raven], and herpestidae [meerkat]. All of the species have adapted bipedalism similar to [human].
                    There are high efficiency solar panels installed on planets close to the sun. These energies are then transferred to the Planet using long-range wireless power transmission.

                    Atsali (“steel” in Greek) is an artificial continent that is made to be separated from other parts of the planet. There are strict laws forbidding anyone except authorized personnel from leaving Atsali. The original intention was to preserve biodiversity through self-isolation.
                </li>
                <li class="text3">
                    Atsali is located in the middle of the [Pacific] Ocean. With [Hawaii] as one of its three edges, it forms an equilateral triangle. Every edge is 2000 kilometers, with 26 cities distributed along it. There are a total of 351 cities. Every one of them is roughly 20 kilometers in diameter.
                </li>
                <li class="text3">
                    Giant architectures of basic geometric forms can be seen distributed across the cities. These are servers and databases for reality simulations.
                </li>
                <li class="text3">
                    Other architectures are built on platforms made out of steel. Columns and rows of these stacks go across each other, forming a waffle-like urban fabric.
