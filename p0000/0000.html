                    The secret to the rapidly developing technology today is the invention of the Consciousness Transmitter (CT). It allows the subjectâ€™s consciousness to be uploaded into a preprogrammed simulation where the subject will acquire a certain skill or conduct certain experiments. In those sandboxes, time-flow velocity (TFV) is customizable. However, based on the complexity and scale of the simulation, there is a limit to the conversion ratio to prevent system malfunction, which in most cases results in death of the subjects. 
                    <br><br>
                    There is also a high level of artificial general intelligence (AGI) technology available for use among some of the large organizations. This technology is later revealed to be the consciousness transmitter itself. It duplicates human consciousness and manipulates their memories only to sell them as artificial intelligence.
                    <br><br>
                    There are a number of organizations that have access to the CT and AGI technologies. One of them is responsible for the education of citizens. A ten-year simulation of education is mandatory for everyone, which has a TFV ratio of 1/5, meaning a two-year session in the real world. During this simulation, everyone is given randomized identity and no prior memory, which alleviates conflicts between physically determined social groups.
